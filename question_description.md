# FastAPI Fundamentals Project - Question Description

## Overview

This project focuses on setting up a basic FastAPI application that handles fundamental HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and integrates JSON handling. The project aims to help you understand how to build a simple RESTful API using FastAPI and interact with it through HTTP requests.

## Project Objectives

1. **Set up FastAPI:** Learn how to install and configure FastAPI in a Python environment, including virtual environment management and dependency installation.
   
2. **Implement Basic HTTP Methods:**
   - Create routes that handle `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP requests.
   - Understand the concept of path parameters and JSON data handling within these methods.

3. **JSON Handling:**
   - Learn how to define data models using Pydantic for validation and serialization of JSON data.
   - Practice receiving and returning JSON in API requests and responses.

4. **Interactive Documentation:**
   - Leverage FastAPI's built-in support for generating Swagger UI and ReDoc to document your API interactively.
   
5. **Error Handling and Status Codes:**
   - Implement error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for "Not Found", 201 for "Created").

## Key Features to Implement

- A basic FastAPI application with at least five endpoints:
  - `GET /`: A simple route returning a welcome message.
  - `GET /items/`: Retrieve a list of all items.
  - `GET /items/{id}`: Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
  - `POST /items/`: Create a new item.
  - `PUT /items/{id}`: Update an item by its ID.
  - `DELETE /items/{id}`: Delete an item by its ID.

- **Data Model Example:**
   - `Item` model with fields such as `id`, `name`, `description`, and `price`.

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **FastAPI Setup:** Understand the process of setting up FastAPI and running the app with Uvicorn.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in an API.
- **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic models to ensure data consistency and validity in requests and responses.
- **API Documentation:** Learn how FastAPI automatically generates Swagger UI and ReDoc for API documentation.
- **Status Codes:** Properly implement and return status codes for each operation.
- **Error Handling:** Handle common errors such as not found items and invalid input.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, you will have a working FastAPI application with the ability to handle basic HTTP methods and serve JSON data. You will also be familiar with generating interactive API documentation and managing errors effectively.

## Additional Considerations

- Expand the project to handle more complex data models and incorporate database interaction.
- Improve error handling and validation to ensure robustness in a real-world application.
